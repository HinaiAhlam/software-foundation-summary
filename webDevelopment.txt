Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves everything from building how a website looks (design) to how it works behind the scenes (functionality).

Three main parts of Web Development
1. Front-End Development (Client-Side)

This is what users see and interact with on the screen.
Front-end developers are responsible for:

✅ 1. Making the website look good

They build the layout, colors, buttons, text, images, etc.

✅ 2. Making the website easy to use

Menus, forms, and buttons should work smoothly.

✅ 3. Making it work on all devices

The site should look good on phones, tablets, and computers.

✅ 4. Adding interaction

Like clicking a button, showing a popup, or loading new content without refreshing.

✅ 5. Connecting with the backend

They get data from the server and show it to the user.


Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Examples: Layouts, buttons, forms, animations, navigation menus.





2. Back-End Development (Server-Side)

This is the behind-the-scenes logic that makes a website work.

Languages/technologies: Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, Ruby, databases like MySQL, MongoDB

Handles: User accounts, data storage, security, server operations.

3. Full-Stack Development

A full-stack developer works on both front-end and back-end parts of a website.



🟩 Backend Responsibility (Very Simple)

Backend is the part of a website that works behind the scenes.

It is responsible for:

Storing data (like users, orders, messages)

Checking and processing requests (like login, signup, payment)

Keeping everything safe (security)

Sending the right information back to the front-end





database 
A database is used to store and organize information so a website or app can use it later.

It is responsible for:

Saving data (users, products, messages, orders)

Keeping data safe and organized

Giving data back when the backend asks for it


explain in detail the .NET stack tools: SQL Server,   C#,   EF Core,   Linq, Blazor
1. SQL Server

A database that stores your data (tables, rows, columns).

Example: Customer info, products, orders.

2. C#

The programming language used in .NET.

You write your logic, models, and backend code in C#.

3. EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

A tool that connects C# code to the database.

Lets you work with C# objects instead of writing raw SQL.

Example: db.Products.Where(p => p.Price < 100) gets cheap products.

4. LINQ

A query language inside C# to filter, sort, and manipulate data easily.

Works with EF Core (database) or lists in memory.

5. Blazor

A front-end framework for building web apps using C# instead of JavaScript.

Can run on server (Blazor Server) or in browser (Blazor WebAssembly).
