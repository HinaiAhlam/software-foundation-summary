Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves everything from building how a website looks (design) to how it works behind the scenes (functionality).

Three main parts of Web Development
1. Front-End Development (Client-Side)

This is what users see and interact with on the screen.
Front-end developers are responsible for:

✅ 1. Making the website look good

They build the layout, colors, buttons, text, images, etc.

✅ 2. Making the website easy to use

Menus, forms, and buttons should work smoothly.

✅ 3. Making it work on all devices

The site should look good on phones, tablets, and computers.

✅ 4. Adding interaction

Like clicking a button, showing a popup, or loading new content without refreshing.

✅ 5. Connecting with the backend

They get data from the server and show it to the user.


Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Examples: Layouts, buttons, forms, animations, navigation menus.





2. Back-End Development (Server-Side)

This is the behind-the-scenes logic that makes a website work.

Languages/technologies: Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, Ruby, databases like MySQL, MongoDB

Handles: User accounts, data storage, security, server operations.

3. Full-Stack Development

A full-stack developer works on both front-end and back-end parts of a website.



🟩 Backend Responsibility (Very Simple)

Backend is the part of a website that works behind the scenes.

It is responsible for:

Storing data (like users, orders, messages)

Checking and processing requests (like login, signup, payment)

Keeping everything safe (security)

Sending the right information back to the front-end





database 
A database is used to store and organize information so a website or app can use it later.

It is responsible for:

Saving data (users, products, messages, orders)

Keeping data safe and organized

Giving data back when the backend asks for it
