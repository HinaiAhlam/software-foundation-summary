Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves everything from building how a website looks (design) to how it works behind the scenes (functionality).

Three main parts of Web Development
1. Front-End Development (Client-Side)

This is what users see and interact with on the screen.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Examples: Layouts, buttons, forms, animations, navigation menus.

2. Back-End Development (Server-Side)

This is the behind-the-scenes logic that makes a website work.

Languages/technologies: Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, Ruby, databases like MySQL, MongoDB

Handles: User accounts, data storage, security, server operations.

3. Full-Stack Development

A full-stack developer works on both front-end and back-end parts of a website.
