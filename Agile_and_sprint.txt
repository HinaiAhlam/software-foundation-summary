A sprint is a short, fixed period in Agile development where a team works to complete a defined set of tasks or deliver a functional product increment. Usually lasting between two and four weeks, each sprint follows a structured process that includes planning, daily meetings, development, testing, and review activities. Sprints are valuable because they help teams maintain focus, adapt quickly to changes, and deliver results regularly. At the beginning of each sprint, the team meets to plan the goals and assign work, while at the end, they review progress and reflect on ways to improve. The annual meeting allows the team to step back, evaluate long-term objectives, and celebrate achievements. By promoting regular testing and feedback, sprints lead to higher product quality and faster problem resolution. The Sprint Review deals with the progress of the product itself, whereas the Sprint Retrospective focuses on improving how the team works together. Challenges like missed deadlines or unclear communication can arise but can be solved through teamwork, transparency, and continuous adjustment. 

The Agile Manifesto is a foundational document for Agile project management, created in 2001 by a group of software developers who wanted a more flexible, collaborative, and adaptive way to build software compared to the rigid, process-heavy methods that dominated the time (like Waterfall).
